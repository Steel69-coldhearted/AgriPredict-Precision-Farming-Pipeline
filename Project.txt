This project proposal is designed specifically for a **Student Data Scientist**. It covers the end-to-end lifecycle of a professional data project, from database engineering to predictive modeling and deployment.



# 📝 Project Proposal: AgriPredict AI

**Domain:** Precision Agriculture & Food Security

**Duration:** 3-Hour Intensive Sprint

## 1. Executive Summary

AgriPredict AI addresses the global challenge of resource-efficient farming.By analyzing soil chemistry (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and environmental conditions (Temperature, Humidity), 
this project provides a data-driven tool for farmers to predict Rainfall Requirements. This helps in reducing water waste and optimizing crop health, directly contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.

| Category | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Language** | Python 3.x |
| **Data Storage** | SQL (SQLite) for structured local storage |
| **Environment** | Jupyter Notebook (for EDA/Modeling) & VS Code (for App) |
| **Libraries** | `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `sqlite3`, `streamlit`, `matplotlib` |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Repository & Interactive Streamlit Dashboard |

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: The Data Pipeline (45 Mins)

* **Source:** Connect to the [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset).
* **Ingestion:** Write a Python script to fetch the raw data and perform basic cleaning (handling nulls, formatting column names).
* **Database Engineering:** Build a local SQL database.
* *Action:* Insert the cleaned data into a SQLite table named `field_data`.
* *Objective:* Demonstrate that you can move data from a "raw" state to a "structured" professional environment.



### Phase 2: Predictive Modeling (60 Mins)

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use Jupyter to visualize which soil nutrients (N, P, K) have the strongest relationship with water needs.
* **Regression Task:** Predict the `Rainfall` (target) based on the soil and temperature metrics (features).
* **Model Selection:** Implement a **Random Forest Regressor**.
* *Reasoning:* Soil data often has "non-linear" interactions that a simple line cannot capture.


* **Evaluation:** Calculate the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. Your report must state exactly how many millimeters off the model is on average.

### Phase 3: Dashboard Development (45 Mins)

* **Tool:** Streamlit.
* **Functionality:** Create a web app where a user can move sliders for Nitrogen or Temperature and see the "Predicted Rainfall Required" update live.
* **Visualization:** Include a chart in the app showing the "Importance of Features"—which factor matters most for the prediction?

### Phase 4: Portfolio Delivery (30 Mins)

* **Documentation:** Write a `README.md` that explains the *Business Value* of the project.
* **Git:** Push your code, your SQL file, and your `app.py` to a public GitHub repository.

## 4. Final Deliverables

1. **A Clean SQL Database:** `agri_data.db` containing the processed readings.
2. **Jupyter Notebook:** A documented analysis of the regression results.
3. **Streamlit App:** A functional dashboard for "Farmer Decisions."
